IRNAS 3D printing OpenSCAD Library
======================

This OpenSCAD library is developed for use in designs for 3D printing and is being actively extended. Parts are designed such, you can subtract them from the main object and when assembling add physical copies of this objects, mostly relating to nuts and bolts, stepper motors etc.

### DIN_screw_nut sub-library
This sub-library contains a few most common screws used with default values set for most of our applications. Parts are designed to be subtracted from the main object, choose extended models which include insert paths that must be clear, so you can actually insert them into your printed objects once made.

### Usage
Download as zip or clone repository to your OpenSCAD libraries folder use `include <OpenSCAD-lib/DIN_screw_nut.scad>;`
