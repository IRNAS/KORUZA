KORUZA mounting
======================
Mounting currently uses a bracket mechanism available on the market [Winncom MT-120018](http://www.winncom.com/en/products/MT-120018) as it is one of a few products that enables angular adjustment in two axis.

### Usage
The one mounting plate is screwed on top of the enclosure (with added silicon sealant), such that the arm is tilted towards the back edge. The other mounting plate attaches to the arm and is then mounted to the horizontal pipe or bolted to a wall. In such orientation/configuration the mount allows the unit to be aimed vertically and horizontally.

### General mounting requirements
Internal KORUZA mechanism has a motorized movement range of about 2-3 degrees. The mechanical mounting mechanism must be sufficiently accurate to allow the unit to be aimed with better then 2 degree accuracy in both axes. Keep in mind that the system is susceptible to thermal expansion effects and the mounting should be designed with this in mind.

### Development goals
The mounting mechanism should be designed such that it can be made from widely available material, preferably from sheet aluminium, suitable for manufacturing with laser or waterjet cutting.
