KORUZA enclosure
======================
The outer KORUZA enclosure houses the main 3D printed assembly and protects the device from weather as well as interfaces the mounting mechanism.

### Design overview
The enclosure is designed to be made from standard square aluminium tubing with 100mm x 100mm x 2mm dimension (outer dimensions and wall thickness) that is available from a range of suppliers. The front section features an overhang to protect the lens from direct exposure to snow and rain. 4 mounting holes on the front side on two sides serve as mounting points for the internal assembly, 4 holes on the top towards the rear for the mounting mechanism and two holes on the rear for mounting the back cover. The large hole on the bottom side is for mounting the PG16 euroflex tube connector.

### Manufacturing
The enclosure can be manufactured with the following methods:
* 3 axis CNC: Manually rotate the tube and cute each side separately. Suitable for low volume
* 4 axis CNC: Automatically cut the tube on all sides. Suitable for low volume.
* Tube laser cutter: Automatically cut all sides. Suitable for high volumes.

### Lid / cover
The back cover for the enclosure is 3D printed and made to house electonics. Designed in OpenSCAD and using [IRNAS OpenSCAD-Lib](https://github.com/IRNAS/OpenSCAD-lib) for common mechanical elements. 3D print from ABS, attach to enclosure with M3 screws.
